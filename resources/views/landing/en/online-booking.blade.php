                        <p>Every site visitor costs a lot. Do you know that dozens of potential consumers just pass by every month? Just imagine that someone couldn’t reach you on the phone, as it was busy or nobody picked it up. Someone didn’t feel free to call from the working place. The other person logged on the website when it was too late in the night, and it was pointless to call. All of these people went to your competitors, because those had a “Make an appointment online” button on their websites.</p>
