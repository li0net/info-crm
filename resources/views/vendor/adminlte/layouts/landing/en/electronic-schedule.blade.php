            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 section-description">
                <p>The relations with clients become a basis of company’s development in the service sector: as more attention is paid to every customer, as higher the possibility of repeat sales. The INFOGROUP.ONLINE booking electronic log will help to establish cooperation. It provides the order record, allows segmenting the client base, that increases loyalty, average paycheck and client’s regular attendance term. The communication is built in three directions:</p>
                <ul class="Glist">
                    <li>loyalty forming – the opportunity to send SMS and email notifications;</li>
                    <li>feedback – sending messages with requests to leave a review after visit;</li>
                    <li>automatic participation in the loyalty programs</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The booking electronic log will let you keep in mind little tasks. You keep record of working time, generate financial reports, correct the schedule, save documents, and keep statistics. Besides, you get guaranties of confidential info security and constant technical support. Keeping records on paper, and making appointments by the phone, you spend a lot of time and risk to loose your data. An “old style” work doesn’t let you track regular clients and create the special privileges for them to increase the loyalty. Electronic log helps to avoid the confusion in schedule, to spread activities among the employees, and reduce the paper work time.</p>
