                    <h5>More regular clients</h5>
                    <p>It’s simple to use a card. A client doesn’t need to find a place for keeping a card or to take it with him, it’ll be always near and it will look good even after a long time.</p>

                    <p>You can quickly and simply grant the card to a client, without paying for printing it. After receiving a card, the client will be one step close to you. All he needs for getting your service is always at his hand.
                        The client is always aware of actual information about the loyalty program and the size of his discount. This allows to avoid misunderstanding and to make the loyalty program terms transparent.</p>
                    <h5>More happy customers</h5>
                    <p>The customers rarely copy the company’s data in the phone book and search the web for info every time again, encountering with competitors’ ads. Using cards, they always can find your info quickly. For instance, they can call in one click or create a route.
                        The use of card brings positive emotions only. The card doesn’t need to be looked for in the application, a card notification is shown on a phone screen in a 100 meters radius from you. To use the card at administrator’s counter, the client can just open it from lock screen.</p>
                    <h5>More appointments</h5>
                    <p>The card is a new way of online booking. It’s kept at the most used device, so the clients always have a quick access to online booking on the back side of the card.
                        The card displays the client’s visits history. Thus, cards help clients to choose the date of visit they need. The clients can always look up when they last visited you, and when the next visit would take place.</p>
