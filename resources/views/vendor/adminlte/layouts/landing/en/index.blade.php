                    <div class="text">Running a bar in Krasnodar is a very profitable business. Everybody like football here. And everybody like to watch it on TV having a mug of beer in a company of friends and neighbors. I’m glad, that I can provide people with such an opportunity in my bar. Recently, I’ve bought a big screen and a new Hi-Fi system, which creates a stadium presence effect inside.<br />Surely, it’s quite good, that there’s no room to swing a cat on match days. That’s why we’ve got a problem: what about those people, who didn’t manage to take a spot in the bar on time? And it wasn’t very pleasant for me either – to go outside and tell those mates, that there’s no more room inside and they are not going to watch football tonight.<br />So it was, until I had heard about the “Info” and its feature of online booking the places in the bar. My visitors book the places right from the mobile phones now. Of course, all comers can’t make it to book for single night. However this thing has allowed us to avoid the crowding at the door on match days.</div>

For that time, we’ve learned enough an acquired much experience in restaurant business. The main thing here is to get everything done on time, keep track of one and all. The order served late means the unhappy client and harm of our business reputation.<br />We’ve had some situations, when suddenly we were running out of a certain product at storage, and it was forgotten to be purchased in time. There’s always a rush at the restaurant, you can’t keep track of everything.<br />But if you have a computer program, which helps to control the inventory and which always shows, how much of different products remains, and which of them are needed to be bought, it would really make your work easier. For now, it’s just so amazing, how we’ve been working without the Info’s “Inventory Control” for so many years!</div>

                    <div class="text">I have a small hairdresser in a quiet neighborhood in Saint-Petersburg. Many people live here all their life, as their grandparents did before. That’s why I always had a plenty of regular customers. Everyone came for haircuts and hair dyeing to my place only, just as a habit. However the number of clients started to grow low due to competition.<br />So I began to think: how should I make my clients stay? A friend suggested me to create a system of bonuses and discounts. I agreed with him, indeed I should’ve thanked people for their attitude! But how could I do that? There are too many of them, and it impossible to reach them all on the phone for short period of time. And it’s also takes too long to send SMS messages to everyone. Finally, I have never done such things before.<br />And once I was told about the “Info” thing – a computer program, which already has a discount system and the list of all clients in it! Since it’s been installed, the computer counts everything and grants customers with discounts and bonuses instead of me. Thanks to “Info”, I’ve not just brought back the old clients, but I’ve found a lot of new ones!</div>

After several years had passed, we collected enough money, and after a year our club was opened.<br />Our first task was to enter the market. There is a great competition among the clubs and bars in Novosibirsk. They have to fight for every visitor. My companions and I had been thinking for long, how attract the customers. We searched the Web and found the information about the “Info” system. We tried the demo version and we liked it. So we’ve decided to use this platform in our business.<br />We were very happy with the results after first two months. The system helped our clients and us to find each other, but it wasn’t all. Thanks to the loyalty program and SMS notifications, customers, once had visited us, became our regulars. Our business grows fast, and we’re glad we’ve found such a salvation.</div>

The other person logged on the website when it was too late in the night, and it was pointless to call. All of these people went to your competitors, because those had a “Make an appointment online” button on their websites.

                    With the INFOGROUP.ONLINE every your employee can get an access to his/her schedule any time, at any place, even with a smartphone. The data is synchronized between all devices immediately. And you can also book your customers with INFOGROUP.ONLINE so simple! After you enter the first digits of the phone number, the system fills the rest of data by itself. But only the owner decides, who ever has an access to customers’ data, and who doesn’t.

                    Does the majority of customers reach you on the phone, but some of them don’t show up anyway? Somebody has forgotten, and the other one hasn’t managed to cancel the appointment by calling. You’ve got a gap in schedule and have lost your money as a result. This is unacceptable. INFOGROUP.ONLINE will remind the customers about their appointments automatically and will reduce absence by 50% minimum. Shy clients will cancel an appointment by clicking the link in a message, and will clear the session time for other people.

                    It’s much cheaper to save your existing regular clients, than to attract the new ones. INFOGROUP.ONLINE can define the most important and loyal customers. It sorts them in different categories automatically, grants them discounts and awards bonuses (this function is planned in). Revealing those, who stopped coming, is very easy. Just make email flyers for them and put them in a queue to call up.
